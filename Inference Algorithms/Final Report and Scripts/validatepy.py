# **NOTE**
# This script will invoke your program, provide input and test output. This is why
# you have to tell this script where your program is. You'd do this by editing the
# "cmd" variable below.
#
# Edit the cmd variable in this file that appears below this comment section,
# type in the command to run your program from the command line, and run *this*
# script as you would run any python program.
#
# Examples (that line below should look like):
#   cmd = "python /absolute/path/to/your/program"
#   cmd = "java com.package.program.Main"
#   cmd = "/location/to/executable-binary"
#   cmd = "python C:\Users\Me\Desktop\program.py" etc.
# Basically, put in the string that you can start from program from a terminal/command line.
#
# How you would run this script:
#   python validate.py 
#
# where *this* file is named validate.py.
